# Sample Data

To help you get started quickly with [`zq`](https://github.com/mccanne/zq), this repository contains small sample sets of [Zeek](https://www.zeek.org/) data. There are four different log formats available, all representing events based on the same network traffic:

| Directory | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| [zeek-default/](zeek-default) | [Zeek default output format](https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/examples/logs/) |
| [zeek-ndjson/](zeek-ndjson) | [ Newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON)](http://ndjson.org/), as output by the Zeek package for [JSON Streaming Logs](https://github.com/corelight/json-streaming-logs) |
| [zng/](zng) | [ZNG](https://github.com/mccanne/zq/blob/master/pkg/zng/docs/README.md), the default output format of [`zq`](https://github.com/mccanne/zq) |
| [bzng/](bzng) | [BZNG](https://github.com/mccanne/zq/blob/master/pkg/zng/docs/README.md), the binary output format of [`zq`](https://github.com/mccanne/zq) |

The examples in the [`zq`](https://github.com/mccanne/zq) documentation are based on this sample data.

We would like to express our thanks to the WRCCDC for generously making their packet capture archives available to the public and for commercial use. The terabytes of "real world" data has been invaluable to us in testing the foundations of `zq` at scale.

# Creation

The data set was made from the several PCAP files in the [2018](https://archive.wrccdc.org/pcaps/2018/) set. [Zeek v3.0.0](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/releases/tag/v3.0.0) was used in its default configuration with the only change being the addition/enabling of the [JSON Streaming Logs](https://github.com/corelight/json-streaming-logs) package. The packet captures were then processed via the command-line:

```
# zeek -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101533000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101551000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101610000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101629000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101737000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101939000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102051000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102126000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102233000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102443000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102602000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102643000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102717000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102733000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102747000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102831000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102920000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103009000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103049000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103117000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103152000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103210000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103224000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103256000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103420000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103630000000000.pcap local
```

This produced the logs in Zeek default and NDJSON formats. As ZNG/BZNG are not yet output directly by Zeek, these logs were created by sending each Zeek default log through `zq`, e.g.:

```
# mkdir -p zng && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  zq -f zng "$file" \
      | gzip -n > zng/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".zng.gz
done


# mkdir -p bzng && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  zq -f bzng "$file" \
      | gzip -n > bzng/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".bzng.gz
done
```

# Testing

Since the sample ZNG/BZNG logs are generated by `zq`, regenerating these outputs is a useful `zq` test. Assuming `zq` is in your `$PATH`, a script is provided to regenerate the hash for each ZNG/BZNG log and compare it to a last known "good" hash stored in the `md5sums/` directory.

#### Example successful output:

```
# scripts/check_md5sums.sh zng
capture_loss:157aea9c046a836d94361327d84e0747
...
x509:6f1ba1e08588282b32e6d28b562686af

diff'ing current "zq -f zng" output hashes vs. committed hashes:

  ======> No diffs found. zng outputs have not changed.
```

#### Example output highlighting a format change has been flagged:

```
# scripts/check_md5sums.sh bzng
capture_loss:62949d22a0a557342d28ee5ee4b64d50
...
x509:10333d3d004c718b04cbedb8ee195cca
