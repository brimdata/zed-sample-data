# Sample Data

To help you get started quickly with [`zq`](https://github.com/brimsec/zq), this repository contains small sample sets of [Zeek](https://www.zeek.org/) data. There are five different log formats available, all representing events based on the same network traffic:

| Directory | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| [zeek-default/](zeek-default) | [Zeek default output format](https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/examples/logs/) |
| [zeek-ndjson/](zeek-ndjson) | [ Newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON)](http://ndjson.org/), as output by the Zeek package for [JSON Streaming Logs](https://github.com/corelight/json-streaming-logs) |
| [zng/](zng) | binary [ZNG](https://github.com/brimsec/zq/blob/master/zng/docs/README.md), output with [`zq`](https://github.com/brimsec/zq)'s default LZ4-compressed format |
| [zng-uncompressed/](zng-uncompressed) | binary [ZNG](https://github.com/brimsec/zq/blob/master/zng/docs/README.md), output with [`zq`](https://github.com/brimsec/zq)'s option `-znglz4blocksize 0` to disable compression |
| [tzng/](tzng) | [TZNG](https://github.com/brimsec/zq/blob/master/zng/docs/README.md), the ZNG text output format of [`zq`](https://github.com/brimsec/zq) |

The examples in the [`zq`](https://github.com/brimsec/zq) documentation are based on this sample data.

# Downloading

Because prior changes to the ZNG/TZNG output formats have added some bulk to the revision history, you'll typically want to save time by just downloading the latest revision:

```
# git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/brimsec/zq-sample-data.git
```

# Origin/License

This sample data set was generated from a subset of the [packet capture archives](https://archive.wrccdc.org/pcaps/) that are distributed by the [WRCCDC](https://www.wrccdc.org/).

We would like to express our thanks to the WRCCDC for generously making their packet capture archives available to the public and for commercial use. The terabytes of "real world" data has been invaluable to us in testing the foundations of `zq` at scale.

# Creation

The data set was made from the several PCAP files in the [2018](https://archive.wrccdc.org/pcaps/2018/) set. [Zeek v3.0.0](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/releases/tag/v3.0.0) was used in its default configuration with the only change being the addition/enabling of the [JSON Streaming Logs](https://github.com/corelight/json-streaming-logs) package. The packet captures were then processed via the command-line:

```
# zeek -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101533000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101551000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101610000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101629000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101737000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.101939000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102051000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102126000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102233000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102443000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102602000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102643000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102717000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102733000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102747000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102831000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.102920000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103009000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103049000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103117000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103152000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103210000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103224000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103256000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103420000000000.pcap -r wrccdc.2018-03-24.103630000000000.pcap local
```

This produced the logs in Zeek default and NDJSON formats. As ZNG/TZNG are not yet output directly by Zeek, these logs were created by sending each Zeek default log through `zq`, e.g.:

```
# mkdir -p zng && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  zq -f zng "$file" \
      | gzip -n > zng/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".zng.gz
done

# mkdir -p zng-uncompressed && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  zq -f zng -znglz4blocksize 0 "$file" \
      | gzip -n > zng-uncompressed/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".zng.gz
done

# mkdir -p tzng && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  zq -f tzng "$file" \
      | gzip -n > tzng/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".tzng.gz
done

```

# Testing

Since the sample ZNG/TZNG logs are generated by `zq`, regenerating these outputs is a useful `zq` test. Assuming `zq` is in your `$PATH`, a script is provided to regenerate the hash for each ZNG/TZNG log and compare it to a last known "good" hash stored in the `md5sums/` directory.

#### Example successful output:

```
# scripts/check_md5sums.sh tzng
capture_loss:157aea9c046a836d94361327d84e0747
...
x509:6f1ba1e08588282b32e6d28b562686af

diff'ing current "zq -f tzng" output hashes vs. committed hashes:

  ======> No diffs found. tzng outputs have not changed.
```

#### Example output highlighting a format change has been flagged:

```
# scripts/check_md5sums.sh zng
capture_loss:62949d22a0a557342d28ee5ee4b64d50
...
x509:10333d3d004c718b04cbedb8ee195cca
