# Sample Data

This repository contains small sample data sets that are intended to assist
in learning and testing the Zed system. Two data sets are currently available:

* [**Educational data** (`edu/`)](edu) - Data regarding schools in the state of
California and their published [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) test
scores. This data is used in most of the examples in the
[Zed language documentation](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/blob/main/docs/language/README.md).

* [**Zeek logs** (`zeek/)`](zeek) - Logs generated by the [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)
open source network security monitoring tool. This data is used in Zed test
automation to ensure the consistency of supported input/output data formats.

# Downloading

Because prior changes to the Zed output formats have added some bulk to the
revision history, you'll typically want to save time by just downloading the
latest revision:

```
# git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/brimdata/zed-sample-data.git
```
