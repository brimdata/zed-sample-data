# Sample Data

To help you get started quickly with [`super`](https://super.brimdata.io/docs/commands/super), this repository contains small sample sets of [Zeek](https://www.zeek.org/) data. There are six different log formats available, all representing events based on the same network traffic:

| Directory | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| [zeek-default/](zeek-default) | [Zeek default output format](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/log-formats.html#zeek-tsv-format-logs) |
| [zeek-json/](zeek-json) | JSON as output by the Zeek package for [JSON Streaming Logs](https://github.com/corelight/json-streaming-logs) |
| [supz/](supz) | [Super Binary (SUPZ)](https://super.brimdata.io/docs/formats/supz) output with [`super`](https://super.brimdata.io/docs/commands/super)'s default LZ4-compressed format |
| [supz-uncompressed/](supz-uncompressed) | [Super Binary (SUPZ)](https://super.brimdata.io/docs/formats/supz), output with [`super`](https://super.brimdata.io/docs/commands/super)'s option `-supz.compress=false` to disable compression |
| [sup/](sup) | [Super JSON (SUP)](https://super.brimdata.io/docs/formats/sup), a text output format for super-structured data that has the look and feel of JSON |

This sample data is used frequently for a [simple performance test](https://github.com/brimdata/super/blob/main/performance/README.md) and to [check for unexpected changes in the super output formats](https://github.com/brimdata/super/blob/main/scripts/output-check.sh).

# Downloading

Because prior changes to the output formats have added some bulk to the revision history, you'll typically want to save time by just downloading the latest revision:

```
# git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/brimdata/super-sample-data.git
```

# Origin/License

This sample data set was generated from a subset of the [https://archive.wrccdc.org/pcaps](packet capture archives) that are distributed by the [WRCCDC](https://www.wrccdc.org/).

This sample data is [licensed](LICENSE) under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, as it is built upon the WRCCDC pcap data that is distributed under the same license.

# Acknowledgement

We would like to express our thanks to the WRCCDC for generously making their packet capture archives available to the public and for commercial use. The terabytes of "real world" data has been invaluable to us in testing the foundations of `super` at scale.

# Creation

The data set was made from several pcap files in the 2018 set. [Zeek v6.2.0](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/releases/tag/v6.2.0) was used in its default configuration with the only change being the addition/enabling of the [JSON Streaming Logs](https://github.com/corelight/json-streaming-logs) package. The packet captures were then processed via the command-lines:

```
# mergecap -w wrccdc.pcap wrccdc.2018-03-24.10*.pcap
# zeek -r wrccdc.pcap local "JSONStreaming::enable_log_rotation=F"
```

This produced the logs in Zeek default and JSON formats. As SUP and SUPZ are not yet output directly by Zeek, these logs were created by sending each Zeek default log through `supe`, e.g.:

```
# mkdir -p supz && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  super -f supz "$file" \
      | gzip -n > supz/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".supz.gz
done

# mkdir -p supz-uncompressed && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  super -f supz -supz.compress=false "$file" \
      | gzip -n > supz-uncompressed/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".supz.gz
done

# mkdir -p sup && \
for file in zeek-default/*
do
  super -f sup "$file" \
      | gzip -n > sup/"$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.log\.gz//')".sup.gz
done
```

# Testing

Since the sample SUP and SUPZ logs are generated by `super`, regenerating these outputs is a useful `super` test. Assuming `super` is in your `$PATH`, a script is provided to regenerate the hash for each SUP and SUPZ log and compare it to a last known "good" hash stored in the `md5sums/` directory.

#### Example output highlighting a format change has been flagged:

```
# scripts/check_md5sums.sh supz
capture_loss:62949d22a0a557342d28ee5ee4b64d50
...
x509:10333d3d004c718b04cbedb8ee195cca
